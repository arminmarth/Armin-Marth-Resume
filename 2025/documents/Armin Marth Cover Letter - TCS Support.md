Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the IT Support Engineer position at Tata Consultancy Services. With over ten years of diverse experience in the IT sector and a recent Certificate IV in Cyber Security from TAFE NSW, I am eager to bring my skills and expertise to your esteemed organization.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated proficiency in system administration, troubleshooting, project management, and customer support. My roles at companies like Absolute IT Consulting and APCD/PLOY have equipped me with the skills necessary to effectively support and manage IT systems. I have experience in designing, testing, and implementing network solutions, as well as providing personalized IT support to small businesses.

In my recent academic pursuits, I have focused on cyber security, learning to implement and manage security infrastructure, analyze cybersecurity data, and develop incident response plans. These skills, combined with my practical experience in various IT roles, make me well-suited to handle the responsibilities of an IT Support Engineer.

I am particularly adept at using virtualization tools like VMware Workstation, vSphere, and Hyper-V, which I believe will be beneficial in managing TCS\'s IT infrastructure. Additionally, my experience with databases like MS SQL Server and MySQL, along with various CRM and clinical software, enhances my capability to support and improve your IT systems.

As an IT professional committed to continuous learning and improvement, I have also earned certifications such as CompTIA A+, Microsoft Certified Professional, and HDI Help Desk Analyst. These certifications, along with my hands-on experience, equip me to contribute effectively to your team.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join Tata Consultancy Services and contribute to your innovative and dynamic team. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background, skills, and certifications align with the needs of your organization.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to bring my combination of practical experience and recent academic knowledge to Tata Consultancy Services.

Sincerely,

Armin Marth
