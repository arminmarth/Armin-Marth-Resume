Hiring Manager

Opal HealthCare

Sydney, NSW

Dear Hiring Manager,

**RE: Application for ICT Service Desk Support Specialist Position**

I am writing to express my interest in the ICT Service Desk Support Specialist position at Opal HealthCare. With my extensive experience in healthcare IT support and strong technical background, I am confident in my ability to provide exceptional service desk support for your organisation.

My career in healthcare IT began at Mednetwork Systems, where I worked on a busy helpdesk supporting medical practice management software. In this role, I remotely diagnosed and solved a wide range of issues including software unfamiliarity, backend database corruption, and mass outages. I managed a constant stream of phone calls and support tickets, consistently maintaining a 90% first-call resolution rate while handling over 40 calls daily. By implementing improved troubleshooting procedures, I helped reduce average resolution time from 4 hours to 2.5 hours, significantly improving client satisfaction.

My experience at PLOY included working as a contractor at a hospital IT help desk, where I logged calls, troubleshot connectivity issues with doctors\' and nurses\' workstations, performed user provisioning, and managed ticket escalation. I also conducted secure data wipes of laptops to be decommissioned, ensuring compliance with healthcare data security requirements. Additionally, I was deployed to a dozen aged care facilities to identify and map networking data points used by nurses\' stations and admin staff, followed by deploying Wyse thin client terminals, configuring network boot, and educating users on proper use.

At Medical Director, I further developed my healthcare IT expertise while supporting clinical management software. This experience gave me valuable insights into healthcare workflows, clinical applications, and the critical nature of healthcare IT systems. I gained extensive knowledge of practice management systems and secure messaging in healthcare, including HL7 standards, which I understand are relevant to your operations.

I am proficient with the technologies used at Opal HealthCare, including:

\- Active Directory and Microsoft 365/Azure AD/Entra ID for user account management

\- Citrix remote desktop environments for secure remote access

\- Ticketing systems for efficient issue tracking and resolution

\- Healthcare software systems similar to AutumnCare

While I have overview knowledge of AutumnCare specifically, my experience with various healthcare software systems has given me the transferable skills needed to quickly become proficient with your systems. I am adept at managing user accounts, resetting passwords, assigning permissions, and providing both remote and on-site technical support.

As a self-employed IT consultant in recent years, I have further honed my ability to provide comprehensive IT support services, conduct technology upgrades with minimal disruption, and develop effective documentation and training materials. I understand the importance of maintaining system availability in healthcare environments where technology directly impacts care delivery.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my healthcare IT experience and technical skills to Opal HealthCare, contributing to your mission of providing quality care for older Australians. I am confident that my background in healthcare IT support, combined with my strong communication skills and problem-solving abilities, would make me a valuable addition to your ICT team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your needs.

Yours sincerely,

**Armin Marth**
